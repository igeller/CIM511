Since the last time I updated my portfolio I have had time to think about my design. Right now I have it very narrow so the body of the site maintains the right shapes. By right shapes I mean that each section of the site is supposed to resemble the shapes that are made on the back of my business card. When I get going more I plan to make the shapes expandable and clickable. I am going to attempt to add animation so that when hovering over the different shapes the grow in size. I am not sure if I will use onhover effects or find a plugin. Given my current time constraints I may just do on hover instead of having to worry aboout learning the syntax of a whole plugin or react package. 

Right now I need to get static text placed so that I can mess around with fonts and colors. I am thinking of using the same font as my resume but nothing is decided for sure. It is all a work in progress and I cant wait to finalize it.
