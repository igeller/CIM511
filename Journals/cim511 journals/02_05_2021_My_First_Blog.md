# My First Journal

First, hello and welcome to my journal/ blog about my creative progress and what I am up to each week while prepping my final portfolio.

Second, I am excited to be writing this as I think it will give me a great opportunity to express my ideas and give insight into my work process. 

Throughout this series of posts I will share the creative process as well as why I have chosen to include some projects in my final portfolio instead of others. I will likely have different checklists as well as other notes to myself so, in addition to my trello, I remember that I need to come back and finish things (like linking to more formal descriptions and details of finalized projects).

The work that I will be discussing are the pieces that I plan to include in my final portfolio website. I have pretty high hopes for the site but would much rather review and improve old work than create just a fabulous website (though it would make a great portfolio piece). 

I guess I also need to start by introducing myself and what I do. I am a computer science major with a double major in interactive media. It is my dream to do software engineering, become a versed full stack engineer for web and mobile, and maybe one day teach the trade to others. During these crazy times I am thankful that upon graduation I already have a job lined up so I just have time to create a cool portfolio and make a ton of headway so it is ready for my next adventure. 

On to the good stuff.

So this week I combed through some of my old work and tried to determine which projects I would like to take on this semester to fix-up and prep for my portfolio, as well as what I think needs to be completed for each. (see page 1 at the bottom and 2)
