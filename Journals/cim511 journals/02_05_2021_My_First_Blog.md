# My First Journal

First, hello and welcome to my journal/ blog about my creative progress and what I am up to each week while prepping my final portfolio.

Second, I am excited to be writing this as I think it will give me a great opportunity to express my ideas and give insight into my work process. 

Throughout this series of posts I will share the creative process as well as why I have chosen to include some projects in my final portfolio instead of others. I will likely have different checklists as well as other notes to myself so, in addition to my trello, I remember that I need to come back and finish things (like linking to more formal descriptions and details of finalized projects).

The work that I will be discussing are the pieces that I plan to include in my final portfolio website. I have pretty high hopes for the site but would much rather review and improve old work than create just a fabulous website (though it would make a great portfolio piece).
