# The Importance of GeoMuse

As will be portrayed later in my portfolio, my primary focus is on software engineering. So why am I including GeoMuse? My choice to include geomuse is based on an industry standard for proficient software engineers. The main focus should always come down to a customer focus. The reason the job of a software engineer exists is to create a wonderful experience for the customer. Implementing the engaging designs, ensuring data is transferred quickly and correctly, and to give the customer a helpful product. So based on all of that I have decided to include geomuse, the website, and all of the research that I did to prove to potential employers that I am capable of considering the customer. I did research to determine the most natural interfaces and layouts as well as features that I thought would be intuitive for the user. I believe that GeoMuse represents my attention to detail as well as my ability to focus on the user group of any product I will eventually work on.
