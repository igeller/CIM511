# Finally Journaling Again!

So the past few weeks have been very busy with other work as well as trying to keep up to date on assignments for the class. I am super excited that I have business cards and a resume that I really like so I am super pumped to use them. I also got to spend time playing with pattern and color on my business card which gave me a great idea for the layouut of my portfolio site. On the back of the business card there are a bunch of odd shapes. I am going to use them to section off my site. In my original journal post I showed some of the sites I really liked and there was one that was using color but was still neat and clean. I am going to aim for that but I am going to include a bit more edge.

In terms of making the site I am going to build it using react, next.js and redux. I am also going to attempt to use materialUi instead of react bootstrap because I had trouble with react bootstrap during the first part of my independent study.

Looking forward to getting things under way!!
