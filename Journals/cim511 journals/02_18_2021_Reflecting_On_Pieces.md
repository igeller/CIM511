# Reflection on Work to Include

During class this past week, as well as the week before my professor stressed how important it was to display pieces in the portfolio that align with the work that I want to do as a job

IDEAS:
-for this week talk about how you plan to actually add some more theory stuff 
-how you plan to give the basics aon the site as well as a few solid coding projects (specify)
-discuss which if any of the design projects you will use
-talk about which projects will get case studies
-formalize the plan for when these things will be finished
-add pics and links to trello
