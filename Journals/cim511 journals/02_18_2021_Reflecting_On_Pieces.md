# Reflection on Work to Include

During class this past week, as well as the week before my professor stressed how important it was to display pieces in the portfolio that align with the work that I want to do as a job. In theory that made this whole project really easy and enjoyable but since I have been through a software engineer interview enough times I know the hard stuff, the theory and application of basic data-structures are super important. So I have re-evaluated some of the work I plan to display to include my documentation and overall interpretation of basic CS material. By that, I mean I plan to add documentation to my GitHub repo's to essentially create a study guide of work. I believe that this will be helpful because it will show potential employers I have the basics down, as well as help me study and gain a better understanding of work that overall is still pretty confusing. 

In addition to the documentation, and possible new implementation (that can be run live from my github)[ **ADD TO TRELLO**] I plan to include a few projects that demonstrate my webdev/ mobile/ design side. 

I love working on front-end because I get to see all of my changes but due to a fabulous internship last summer I am also interested in more of the backend as well as CICD pipelines and more. I really would love to become a fabulous full stack engineer, so I feel doing all of the following work will really help establish that as the job I aim to have.

Updated List of Projects:
1. CSC Basics Documentation
	- 220: Data Structures
		- document each project
		- make general index to link to work
	- 317: Algorithms
		- document the work completed and overall big ideas
			- cheatsheet
	- (time permitting) 322 - system programming
		- create an idex of the different commands learned?
2. Software Engineering Project
	- redesign: show before and after mocks
		- journal and blog about it
	- re-implement
		- use react?
		- react native?
		- will need to re-setup the firebase account
	- case study/ documentation (mostly reviewing the documents turned in for the class)
3. Re-Presenting Art
	- fnish the styling (should be finished by 02/19
		- going to be given to someone to do user tests, will then need to update broken work
	- implementation is already complete (may need to be tweaked)
	- give a general overview and case study
4. GeoMuse: Design Project
	- good to include bc shows skills as a designer...
	- check website for spelling mistakes
	- add a formal case study (ask seelig if what you have on the old site is good)
	- maybe transfer from wix to normal
5. Create Portfolio site
	-checkout and investigate webflow
	- design (based on inspiration files)
		- possible case study as to choices for design... probably more applicable to the dashboard site than this. 


[] look into hosting via github pages (react and others)
	- maybe thats where you can do the portfolio from instead



IDEAS:
-for this week talk about how you plan to actually add some more theory stuff 
-how you plan to give the basics aon the site as well as a few solid coding projects (specify)
-discuss which if any of the design projects you will use
-talk about which projects will get case studies
-formalize the plan for when these things will be finished
-add pics and links to trello
