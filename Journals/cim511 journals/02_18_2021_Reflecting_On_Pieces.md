# Reflection on Work to Include

During class this past week, as well as the week before my professor stressed how important it was to display pieces in the portfolio that align with the work that I want to do as a job. In theory that made this whole project really easy and enjoyable but since I have been through a software engineer interview enough times I know the hard stuff, the theory and application of basic data-structures are super important. So I have re-evaluated some of the work I plan to display to include my documentation and overall interpretation of basic CS material. By that, I mean I plan to add documentation to my GitHub repo's to essentially create a study guide of work. I believe that this will be helpful because it will show potential employers I have the basics down, as well as help me study and gain a better understanding of work that overall is still pretty confusing. 

In addition to the documentation, and possible new implementation (that can be run live from my github)[ **ADD TO TRELLO**] I plan to include a few projects that demonstrate my webdev/ mobile/ design side. 

The 

IDEAS:
-for this week talk about how you plan to actually add some more theory stuff 
-how you plan to give the basics aon the site as well as a few solid coding projects (specify)
-discuss which if any of the design projects you will use
-talk about which projects will get case studies
-formalize the plan for when these things will be finished
-add pics and links to trello
