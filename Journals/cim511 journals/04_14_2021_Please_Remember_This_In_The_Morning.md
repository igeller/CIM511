# Please Remember This in the Morning

This journal is a lot less of a journal and more things that I would like to discuss with the class and get feedback on before continuing my portfolio. Right now my site is set up very similarly to my business cards which I love. However I am also trying to make it formatted similarly to: [https://tobiasahlin.com/] in terms of the clean loayout. What I will be changing is the color and the shape "list item" styles. Questions for the group:

- should I narrow the body and have margins on the side?
  - narrowing would also stretch the letters less and make it easier to read
  - currently trying to get at least 2 letters on one line byt struggling a lot, things keep separating
- some of the shapes can have image backgrounds
- I am going to add animations via
  - https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/use-spring
  - https://liquidswipe.netlify.app/
  - https://www.framer.com/api/motion/

I also will not be using this but a super cool asset for whoever wanted to make theirs like a game. This is a bit childish but you could leverage it!

I have really high hope for the site. In addition, I am not sure if I will have the click on the different sections open like a modal or to a new page. A modal seems best but I have the capability to add more than one page so it would work. 
- i like the idea of the grid example in the followin link https://www.react-spring.io/docs/props/trail
